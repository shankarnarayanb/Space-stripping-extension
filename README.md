This is a Firefox extension that removes leading and trailing spaces from all text input fields(apart from password fields) on the current webpage. The extension will display the number of replacements made on its icon in the toolbar.

## Installation

1. Download the source code from this repository and unzip the files.

2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`.

3. Click on "This Firefox" (on the left side of the screen).

4. Click on "Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦".

5. Navigate to your extension's directory, find the manifest.json file and open it.

The extension will now be temporarily installed in Firefox, and you should see it listed under "Temporary Extensions".

## Usage

1. **Web Surfing, Bhai Sahab(My Brother)**: You're surfing the interwebs and stumble upon a webpage brimming with text input fields. Maybe it's a form, maybe it's a online form, or the web equivalent of Mount Everest: The dreaded Jenkins Nodes and Clouds page. This beast is sprawling with text input fields, each one begging for your attention. It's a veritable jungle of AWS MI ID's , instance types, and whatnot.

2. **Oops, Thoda Extra Ho Gaya(I've added a bit too much) :** In the heat of the moment,  like a little extra spicy masla to the biryani, you find that you've unintentionally added leading and/or trailing spaces to one of the text fields.

3. **Koi Nahi, Sahi Kar Denge(No Worries):** This is where the Space Stripping Extension comes in to save the day.Just give a little click on the extension's icon in the toolbar, like a tap on the shoulder.

4. **Aur Lo! Kamaal Ho Gaya(Voila):** In a jiffy, the extension swings into action, removing all leading and trailing spaces from your text fields (password fields are a no-go area, bhai - it's like the secret recipe to your mom's panner butter masala). 


***Aur sone pe suhaga (The cheery on top)***

The extension will also keep a tally of its victories, displaying the number of replacements made right on its icon in the toolbar. Now, you're back in the driver's seat, ready to tackle Jenkins without fear of your agents breaking down. Jenkins may not warn you about those sneaky spaces, but with the Space Stripping Extension, you've got your own personal space guardian!
